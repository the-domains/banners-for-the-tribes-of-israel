## ZEBULUN - The Banner     ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/98d216a0-7ef2-47e1-998b-72912fe5d7f1.jpg)

3     **GEMSTONE**: Aquamarine, blue-green; the color of the ocean (aqua equals water; marine
equals sea). Zebulun was born of Leah and was the tenth son by Jacob.

4     **NAME IN HEBREW SCRIPT**: "Zebulun"

6     **LEFT STREAMER**: Zebulun means "wished for habitation" or dwelling, from zebuluwn. The
root word is zabal, to enclose. (Genesis 30:19)

7     **PAINTING**: (see next page)

8     **RIGHT STREAMER**: The heavenly sign is the virgin; a sanctuary and safe harbor for the
righteous Messiah Child.

10   **TRIBAL SYMBOL**: The symbol is a ship. "Zebulun shall dwell at the seashore; and he shall
be a haven \[sanctuary\] for ships." (Genesis 49:13)

11    **ASPECT OF THE GOSPEL**: Zebulun, reflecting the virgin birth (incarnation), is the first in
the sequence of the gospel story as reflected in the Mazzeroth. Many theologians have
observed that the sphinx (Egypt) may
represent a perversion of this heavenly
gospel order - a monster with the head of
a virgin and the body of a lion.

\[Many from the tribe of Zebulun were
traders and merchants.\]
