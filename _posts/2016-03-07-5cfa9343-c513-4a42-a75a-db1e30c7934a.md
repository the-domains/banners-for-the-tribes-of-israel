## LEVI - The Prophecies

**Levi - **Third son born to Jacob by Leah 

**Prophecy by Jacob** - "Simeon and Levi are brothers; instruments of cruelty are in their dwelling place. Let not my soul
enter their council; let not my honor be united to their assembly; for in their anger they slew a man,
and in their self-will they hamstrung an ox. Cursed be their anger, for it is fierce; and their wrath, for
it is cruel! I will divide them in Jacob and scatter them in Israel." (Genesis 49:5-7) 

**Prophecy by Moses** - And of Levi he said:"Let YourThummim and Your Urim be with Your holy one, whom You tested at
Massah, and with whom You contended at the waters of Meribah, who says of his father and mother,
'I have not seen them;' Nor did he acknowledge his brothers, or know his own children; for they
have observed Your word and kept Your covenant. They shall teach Jacob Your judgments, and Israel
Your law. They shall put incense before You, and a whole burnt sacrifice on Your altar. Bless his
substance, Lord, and accept the work of his hands; strike the loins of those who rise against him,
and of those who hate him, that they rise not again." (Deuteronomy 33:8-11)
