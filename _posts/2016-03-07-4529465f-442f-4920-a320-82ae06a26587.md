**The Breastplate** (worn by the high priest):"You shall make the breastplate of judgment ... of gold,
blue, purple, and scarlet thread, and fine woven linen ... It shall be doubled into a square ... And you
shall put settings of stones in it, four rows of stones. The first row shall be a sardius, a topaz, and an
emerald; this shall be the first row; the second row shall be a turquoise, a sapphire, and a diamond;
the third row, a jacinth, an agate, and an amethyst; and the fourth row, a beryl, an onyx, and a jasper.
They shall be set in gold settings. And the stones shall have the names of the sons of Israel, twelve ... "
(Exodus 28:15-21) 

**Articles of the Tabernacle**: Painted within six of the stones are the articles of the tabernacle. On
the bottom middle stone is painted the altar of burnt offering. (Exodus 35:16) The next stone up
is the laver and its base. (Exodus 35:16) The next stone up and to the left is the lampstand for the
light. (Exodus 35:14) The middle stone depicts the incense altar. (Exodus 35:15) The next stone to
the right is the table and its poles, all its utensils, and the showbread. (Exodus 35:13) And the top
stone in the middle is the ark and its poles, with the mercy seat. (Exodus 35:12) 

**The Scales**: The heavenly sign painted at the bottom of the breastplate is for justice. (Deuteronomy
25:15) "You shall have a perfect and just weight, a perfect and just measure, that your days may be
lengthened in the land which the Lord your God is giving you. None of them can by any means
redeem his brother, nor give to God a ransom for him-for the redemption of their souls is costly,
and it shall cease forever ... " (Psalms 49:7-8) 

"Surely men of low degree are a vapor, Men of high degree are a lie; If they are weighed on the scales,
They are altogether lighter than vapor." (Psalms 62:9) 

Only one can be just and is able to pay the price. And they sang a new song, saying:"You are worthy
to take the scroll, And to open its seals; For You were slain, And have redeemed us to God by Your
blood." (Revelation 5:9)
