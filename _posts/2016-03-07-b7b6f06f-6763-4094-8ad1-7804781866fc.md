3**GEMSTONE**: The gemstone is the garnet or beryl- blood red- formed under pressure,
and symbolic of the blood of priestly sacrifices. The Latin word for garnet is granatum
(pomegranate), which is embroidered into the high priest's robe. (Exodus 28:33-34) 

4     **NAME IN HEBREW SCRIPT**: "Levi"
6 LEFT STREAMER: Literal meaning of Levi means joined, fastened to, attached, devoted,
knotted, united. Levi's mother Leah felt unloved. Jacob loved her sister Rachel, who was
barren. So after this third son, Leah said, "Now this time my husband will be joined to me."
(Genesis 29:34) 

7     **PAINTING**: (see next page) 

8     **RIGHT STREAMER**: The sign is the scales. The scales stand for justice, which is reflected
in the law which came through and was taught by the tribe of Levi. (Deuteronomy 25:15)
The law (teaching) will go forth from Zion, and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem."
(Isaiah 2:3-4; Micah 4:2-3) 

1 0    **TRIBAL SYMBOL**: The image on the
banner for Levi is the breastplate containing
the gemstones of the twelve tribes, which
is worn by the high priest over his heart.
(Exodus 28:15-21) 

12    **ASPECT OF THE GOSPEL**: Redeemer. To
redeem means to buy back. "For you were
bought at a price ... " (I Corinthians 6:20)
