**The Ship**: from Genesis 49:13 "Zebulun shall dwell at the seashore; and he shall be a haven
(sanctuary) for ships." The ship is a symbol of "sending out" (missions). "Their sound goes out to
the ends of the earth." (Psalms 19:4; Romans 1 0:18) Zebulun's ship image is confirmed in Deuteronomy
33:18/'Rejoice, Zebulun, in your going forth." 

**The clouds** confirm the gospel being sent throughout the earth. The clouds drop rain -a symbol
of the Lord's favor. (Deuteronomy 11 :14; compare with Ezekiel1 :28) Rain from the clouds represents
the Lord's favor. The brightness of the sky represents the glory of the Lord. "Behold, He is coming
with clouds, and every eye will see Him ... " (Revelation 1 :7; Matthew 26:64) 

**The Virgin**: " ... a virgin shall conceive and bear a Son, and shall call His name Immanuel." (Isaiah 7:14)
The ship in port is a safe harbor (womb). (Note: Nazareth is located in the land that Joshua allocated
to the tribe of Zebulun. (Joshua 19:1 0-16) 

**The Branch** is held by the virgin. Of the twenty Hebrew words translated "branch/' only one, tsemech,
is used exclusively for the Messiah/' ... I am bringing forth My Servant the Branch." (Zechariah 3:8;
compare with Isaiah 4:2; Jeremiah 23:5; and Zechariah 6:12) 

**The ear of corn** refers to the virgin's seed from which comes the harvest. "And I will put enmity
between you and the woman, and between your seed and her Seed; He shall bruise your head, and
you shall bruise His heel." (Genesis 3:15)
